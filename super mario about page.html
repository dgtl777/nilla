         <h1>Super Mario World 3</h1>
    <h2>
        The game levels play similarly to those of Super Mario 3D Land, which combine the free-roaming 
        gameplay of the Super Mario franchise's 3D games with the mechanics of its 2D side-scrollers, including a timer
         and a level-ending flagpole.[5] Up to four concurrent players may control player characters, including Mario, Luigi,
          Princess Peach, Toad, and the unlockable Rosalina. Similar to their appearances in Super Mario Bros. 2,[6] 
          each of the characters possesses unique abilities and controls differently: Mario has balanced running speed and jump height;
           Luigi jumps higher and falls slower, but has slightly lower traction; Peach can jump and briefly float through the air,
            but runs slowly; Toad runs the fastest, but cannot jump as high and falls faster; 
            Rosalina can use the spin attack move as seen in the Super Mario Galaxy games, 
            but has the slowest running speed.[7] The player can select any of the five characters to use before beginning a level,
             and up to four players may explore the same level simultaneously, sharing from a pool of lives. Players are also able to
              pick up, carry, and throw each other.[8] </h2>
         <h2>
        Levels are accessed through a world map, in which players can find hidden areas to earn more items or coins.
         Each level contains three collectable Green Stars, which are required to access certain levels, 
         and each main level contains a hidden Stamp which was used in handwritten posts to the now defunct Miiverse online community.
          Players can also view messages left by other players, both on the world map and after clearing a level, 
          and can download 'Mii Ghosts', which are live records of other players completing levels. Ghosts can be raced against, 
          and may hold gift prizes such as coins or extra lives.[9] Additional Green Stars can be earned in Captain Toad, Mystery House,
           and Challenge levels.[10][11]
