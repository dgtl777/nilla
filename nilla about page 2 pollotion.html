    <h2>We are certain that there is still time to prevent plastic from entering our oceans and killing sealife.
        If you check out our Blog Page you can see that we care for animals very much 
        but unfortunatly plasic is killing many of our incredible creatures.
         We belive that if we don't stop plastic from getting inside our oceans, 
         there will be more plasic than fish in our seas by 2050. To support us you can buy our products such as re-useable 
         water bottles. All of the money we make from selling products will go towards preventing plastic from entering our oceans.
         Thank you so much for all your support so far and we promise that we will try our hardest to solve this disater.

    <h2 id="h2">The Top 15 Plastic Pollution Facts</h2>
        <h2>  1. Up to 422 million tonnes of plastic are being produced each year.
        This could weigh more than humanity, estimated at 316 million tonnes in 2013.<br>
        2. Up to 12.7 million tonnes of plastic enter the Ocean every year.
         If waste management practices don't improve, scientists predict this amount could increase tenfold by 2025.<br>
        3. Plastics make up to around 75% of marine litter, although this can be up to 100% at some sites.
        Plastic in the Ocean breaks up into smaller fragments called microplastics, which have been identified in commercial fish consumed by humans.<br>
        4. Plastic in the Ocean breaks up into smaller fragments called microplastics.
        Plastic will never go away. These microplastics have been identified in commercial fish consumed by humans.<br>
        5. Half of all plastics are single-use applications, used just once and then disposed of.
        We are all guilty of this. But small behaviour changes can make a massive impact. The next time you are about to dispose of a plastic product, think about if you can reuse it for a different purpose. <br>
        6. Plastic was invented 150 years ago.
        It never goes away it just gets smaller, making it harder to remove from the Ocean. Plastic is indestructible, it was designed to defy nature, and designed not to decompose. When we see the stat, 'plastic takes 450 years to decompose' we will never know this for sure, it has not been around long enough for us to put a time stamp on it.<br>
        7. Birds are highly susceptible to plastic ingestion.
        It is estimated that over 90% of all seabirds have ingested plastic.<br>
        8. There is no giant floating island of plastic at the centre of the Pacific or any other parts of the Ocean.
        The so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch is invisible from the surface however, plankton nets reveal the true nature of the problem which is an accumulation of microplastics that fill up each net in concentrations that increase towards the Ocean centre.<br>
        9. Plastic acts as a sink for chemicals in the environment, and transports them.
        When the plastic is mistakenly consumed by marine life these plastic chemicals are released and stored in the fatty tissue of the animal. They then travel up the marine food chain, magnifying in concentration on their way up.<br>
        10. Chemicals are added to plastic during its production.
        This gives the product certain properties and some known endocrine disruptors which have been linked to critical disease including, birth defects, cancer, autoimmune disease, infertility and cognitive and behavioural disorders.

        <h2>To keep plastic out of our oceans, we are working on intercepting waste before it enters the oceans in Cape Town.
            The first step was collaborating with The Litterboom Project to intercept waste in Cape Town's rivers.
             Our goal is to get Litterbooms across all of the city's major rivers,
              to keep as much plastic from entering the oceans as possible.
           Our next focus as we journey upstream is intentional illegal dumping,
            which is a primary cause of much of the waste in our environment and entering our rivers.
             We are working with City management to find solutions to this pervasive problem,
              such as the provision of skips and increased security, as well as helping to clean-up dumping hotspots.
           We also have a program to educate and inspire youths from under-serviced areas about plastic pollution and conservation. 
           The youngsters involved so far have taken amazing initiative to clean up their community. Each donation of just £130
            will support another youth awareness event and outing for the environmental stewards.
           As part of our journey upstream we also plan to work on better EPR for plastic producers and lobby towards a single-use 
           plastic-free South Africa by 2025.
